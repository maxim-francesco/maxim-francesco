# Hi, I'm Maxim Francesco 👋

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca with a strong passion for **CyberSecurity**. My background in low-level systems (`C/C++`, `Assembly`), operating systems, and full-stack development has built a solid foundation for exploring vulnerability research, secure system design, and reverse engineering. I am driven by the challenge of understanding how systems work in order to protect them.

## 🚀 About Me

- 📍 Based in Cluj-Napoca, Romania
- [cite_start]🎓 Final-year CS student at Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (UTCN), Faculty of Automation and Computer Science [cite: 53]
- 🔐 Passionate about **CyberSecurity**, Reverse Engineering, and Secure Coding
- 💡 Strong foundation in:
  - [cite_start]Operating Systems (C, IPC & Process Synchronization) [cite: 54]
  - [cite_start]Low-Level Programming (x86 Assembly, C++) [cite: 91]
  - [cite_start]Full-Stack Development (Java Spring Boot, Angular) [cite: 36, 18]
  - [cite_start]Computer Networking & Distributed Systems [cite: 54]

## 💼 Notable Projects

### Full-Stack & AI Projects
- [cite_start]**AI-Powered Restaurant Management System** – A modular platform with 7 backend microservices (Spring Boot) and 2 Angular SPAs, enhanced with voice-enabled AI agents for orders & reservations. [cite: 57, 58, 59, 60]
- [cite_start]**Telemedicine Platform** – A cloud-based system using Azure SQL/Blob Storage for managing online consultations, featuring role-based auth, file management, and real-time video calls. [cite: 67, 69, 72]
- [cite_start]**Travel Buddy (Hackathon Top 10%)** – A React-based travel planner with an AI chat interface and an AI agent that makes real-time booking calls using text-to-speech technology. [cite: 76, 77, 78, 82]
- [cite_start]**SCT-Center Color Segmentation (C++ & OpenCV)** – A medical image processing app that segments skin lesions for melanoma diagnosis using the SCT-Center color segmentation algorithm. [cite: 85, 87, 91]

### Low-Level & University Projects
- **OS Projects (C)** – In-depth projects covering file parsing, inter-process communication with threads & pipes, and complex process synchronization challenges.
- **FA Assignments (C++)** – Implementations of fundamental algorithms including sorting, heaps, and hashing, complete with a custom profiler for algorithm benchmarking.
- **Assembly Snake Game (x86)** – A complete, canvas-based snake game written from scratch in x86 Assembly, managing direct memory access, graphics rendering, and keyboard input.
