# Hi, I'm Maxim Francesco 👋

I'm a **Frontend Developer Intern** at **NTT DATA Cluj**, with nearly 1 year of hands-on experience building modern, responsive, and user-centric web applications. I specialize in **Angular**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **AI-integrated apps**. Beyond the frontend, I actively explore full-stack development and machine learning — currently researching **Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving** as part of my thesis.

## 🚀 About Me

- 📍 Based in Cluj-Napoca, Romania
- 🎓 Final-year CS student at Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (UTCN), Faculty of Automation and Computer Science
- 💼 Intern @ NTT DATA (Jul 2024 – Jul 2025)
- 🤖 Exploring Machine Learning, AI Agents & VLMs
- 💡 Strong foundation in:
  - Operating Systems (C & IPC)
  - Java & Swing (OOP + GUI)
  - Image Processing with OpenCV (C++)
  - x86 Assembly Projects (e.g., Snake Game)
  - Software Design, Threads, and Synchronization

## 💼 Notable Projects

- **Tinder Clone** – Angular + Spring Boot dating app with swiping, matches, and chat  
- **Travel Buddy** – React + AI Agents app built at a hackathon (ElevenLabs, Twilio, n8n, Google Maps)  
- **Stroke Prediction** – ML app using decision trees and logistic regression for medical datasets  
- **Expense Tracker** – Angular + Firebase app with OCR (Google Vision) and Gemini AI integration  
- **PT Assignments (Java)** – Complex UI generation, layered architecture, multithreading, MySQL  
- **OS Projects (C)** – File parsing, threads & pipes, and process sync (all 10/10 grades)  
- **FA Assignments (C++)** – Sorting, heaps, hashing, and profiler for algorithm benchmarking  
- **Assembly Snake Game** – Canvas-based snake game in x86 ASM with input & memory control
