# Hi, I'm Maxim Francesco 👋

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca with a strong passion for **CyberSecurity**. My background in low-level systems (`C/C++`, `Assembly`), operating systems, and full-stack development has built a solid foundation for exploring vulnerability research, secure system design, and reverse engineering. I am driven by the challenge of understanding how systems work in order to protect them.

## About Me

- 📍 Based in Cluj-Napoca, Romania  
- 🎓 Final-year CS student at Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (UTCN), Faculty of Automation and Computer Science  
- 🔐 Passionate about **CyberSecurity**, Reverse Engineering, and Secure Coding  
- 💡 Strong foundation in:  
  - Operating Systems (C, IPC & Process Synchronization)  
  - Low-Level Programming (x86 Assembly, C++)  
  - Full-Stack Development (Java Spring Boot, Angular)  
  - Computer Networking & Distributed Systems  

## Notable Projects

### Full-Stack & AI Projects

- **AI-Powered Restaurant Management System** – A modular platform with 7 backend microservices (Spring Boot) and 2 Angular SPAs, enhanced with voice-enabled AI agents for orders & reservations.  
- **Telemedicine Platform** – A cloud-based system using Azure SQL/Blob Storage for managing online consultations, featuring role-based auth, file management, and real-time video calls.  
- **Travel Buddy (Hackathon Top 10%)** – A React-based travel planner with an AI chat interface and an AI agent that makes real-time booking calls using text-to-speech technology.  
- **SCT-Center Color Segmentation (C++ & OpenCV)** – A medical image processing app that segments skin lesions for melanoma diagnosis using the SCT-Center color segmentation algorithm.  

### Low-Level & University Projects

- **OS Projects (C)** – In-depth projects covering file parsing, inter-process communication with threads & pipes, and complex process synchronization challenges.  
- **FA Assignments (C++)** – Implementations of fundamental algorithms including sorting, heaps, and hashing, complete with a custom profiler for algorithm benchmarking.  
- **Assembly Snake Game (x86)** – A complete, canvas-based snake game written from scratch in x86 Assembly, managing direct memory access, graphics rendering, and keyboard input.
